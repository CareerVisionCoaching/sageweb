                    <div class="faq-question">What is Sage.coach?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Sage.coach is an all-in-one platform for career coaching. It combines structured roadmaps, collaborative workspaces, and AI-powered tools to help mid-career tech professionals achieve their career goals faster and with greater clarity.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Who is Sage.coach for?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Sage.coach is designed for mid-career tech professionals seeking promotions, career transitions, or leadership development. It's also for career coaches who want to deliver better results with less administrative overhead.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do I need to work with a coach to use Sage.coach?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">While Sage.coach is most powerful when used with a coach, you can also use it independently to create your own roadmaps and track your progress. However, we recommend working with a certified coach for best results.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How is Sage.coach different from other career tools?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Unlike generic project management tools or scattered career resources, Sage.coach is purpose-built for career coaching. It integrates roadmaps, session logs, document management, AI assistance, and progress tracking in one platform — designed specifically for the coach-client relationship.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is the typical length of a roadmap?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Most clients see results within 3–6 months, but your coach will tailor the roadmap to your specific needs. Some focused goals (like interview prep) may take 4-8 weeks, while larger transitions (like career pivots) may take 6-12 months.</div>
